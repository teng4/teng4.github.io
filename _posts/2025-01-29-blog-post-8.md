# How To generate a triangulate mesh plane in Blender for Unity?

In Unity, the default plane mesh is a 10x10 mesh (to be precisely 11x11 points). Sometimes you may need a plane mesh with more dense points, e.g., 50x50, 100x100, or even more, in order to rendering a cloth with more details. Here below is the steps for generating a 100x100 mesh plane in Blender and export it as OBJ file which can be used in Unity.

## Steps to generate OBJ file from blender.

1. A to select all.
1. Shift+A to select Mesh→Plane. Note, the default size of plane is 2m in Blender.
1. Rotate the plane if needed.
1. TAB to Edit Mode.
1. Select the plane, right-click, select Subdivide, then at the bottom left corner set the cut numbers as 99 (for a plane with 100x100 small squares). Note, limits to Max 100 cuts in Blender.
1. Select all vertices, then go to tab Face→Triangulate Faces, this will generate triangulate mesh on the plane.  (Note, unity requires triangular mesh instead of square or poly.)
1. HOWEVER, the triangular mesh's edges are not always in the same orientation. To obtain mesh edges all with the same orientation, DO NOT use the Face->Triangulate Faces. Instead, select the plane object, go to the modifier (a wrench icon), Add a triangulate modifier, Set Quad Method as Fixed, set N-gon Method as Beauty. Click Apply. TAB to check the result, and now all the triangulate mesh should be with the same orientation.
1. TAB to Object Mode, Ctrl+A to select and apply All Transforms.
1. Export to OBJ files: check SectionOnly, check Geometry/Triangulate Faces, maybe also try Keep Vertex Order.
1. Then click Export. Done.




## Imort OBJ file into Unity:
- Remember to check Read/Write, and Apply. (Important! Although no Error msgs.).
- Import New Assets, then go to find the OBJ file.
- Directly putting the OBJ file into the target folder in Unity seems also ok and has the same result in my test.
