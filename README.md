# Contents
This demo folder includes, 

(1) Q_des, desired trajectory data in form of *.mat and *.txt, and a corresponding image;

(2) MATLAB *.m code for communication between MATLAB and VREP;

(3) SIMULINK *.slx file for communication between SIMULINK and VREP (via Sfunction);

(4) A scene *.ttt file is the virtual PANDA robot in VREP.

(5) File *v1.m can only send joint position command to VREP robot; file *v2.m can retrive joint position data and joint torque data from VREP robot.
