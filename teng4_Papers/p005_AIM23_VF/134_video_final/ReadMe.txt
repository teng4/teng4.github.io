This demo video is supplementary material for the paper titled with "Point-Based 3D Virtual Fixture Generating for Image-Guided and Robot-Assisted Surgery in Orthopedics" (Authors: Teng Li, Armin Badre, Hamid D. Taghirad, Mahdi Tavakoli) in 2023 IEEE/ASME International Conference on Advanced Intelligent Mechatronics (AIM 2023), June 27 -- July 1, Seattle, Washington, USA, 2023.

In the video, you will see four simulations and two experiments that presented in the paper. For simulations, VF (virtual fixture) is generated from four types of point clouds respectively, i.e., a single point, a line segment, a 2D teapot, and a 2D hand-drawn "Î©" symbol (extracted from image). For experiments, the VF alogorithm is implemented to a 7-DOF Franka Emika Panda robot, while VF is generated from a set of point cloud in 2D square shape, and a set of point cloud of hand-drawn curves extracted from a preplanned image, respectively.
