Description:
--
This demo video is supplementary material for the paper titled with "Integrating Impedance Control and Nonlinear Disturbance Observer for Robot-Assisted Arthroscope Control in Elbow Arthroscopic Surgery" (Authors: Teng Li, Armin Badre, Hamid D. Taghirad, Mahdi Tavakoli) in 2022 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2022), October 23-27, Kyoto, Japan, 2022.

In the video, you will see experimental demonstrations for each of the three conditions (i.e., constant payload, time-varying payload, and set-point regulation) presented in the paper, and a preliminary application on elbow arthroscopic surgery with a FAST simulator.
