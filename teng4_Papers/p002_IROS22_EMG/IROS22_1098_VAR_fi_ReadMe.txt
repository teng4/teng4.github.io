Description:
--
This demo video is supplementary material for the paper titled with "EMG-based Hybrid Impedance-Force Control for Human-Robot Collaboration on Ultrasound Imaging" (Authors: Teng Li, Hongjun Xing, Hamid D. Taghirad, Mahdi Tavakoli) in 2022 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2022), October 23-27, Kyoto, Japan, 2022.

In the video, you will hear two sound clips for the audio feedback design, and will see the demonstrations of physical human-robot collaboration on ultrasound imaging task for each of the three experiments (i.e., hybrid impedance-force controller, lifting task, and application) presented in the paper.
